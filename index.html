        <br>
        <p>Hi, my name is Josh and this is <b>my</b> cubing journey.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I first started cubing on April 6th, 2021. I remember that my classmate was solving a Rubik's Cube, and I thought it was SO cool. That night, I went home and solved a cube for the first time. Little did I know how much of an impact that would have on my life now...</p>
